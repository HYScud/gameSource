	   Pokémon shiny sparkle animation by GarchompMatt

======================================================================

Animation created by me (GarchompMatt), but based heavily on Gold/Silver's shiny sparkle animation, right down to the amount of frames used and what's contained within each frame. The only actual difference is the resolution and quality ;)

Free to use, by the way. Totally open-source. Credit would be very nice, but isn't necessary, given that Game Freak did all the hard work :P

For best results, I adivise placing the sprites at (x)76 and (y)130. Obviously, the animation needs to use additional transparency, otherwise you'd get horrible black outlines around the sparkles :P
